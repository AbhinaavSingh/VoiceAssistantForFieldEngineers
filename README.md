# VoiceAssistantForFieldEngineers
This is a POC in python for Voice Assistant for OilField Engineers. It helps them get the relevant information about tools and equipment on the well-site.  I have used Google-Speech package for speech recognition and the gTTS package for Text to speech functionality. The database for this is in sqlite.
